A similar letter was sent by hospital and nursing home groups. No investigation has been announced by the White House or FTC. However, the letters did not call for pay caps on what travel nurses make, nor has any legislation been proposed in Congress. The two main authors of the letter said they do not want to see lower pay for travel nurses as a result and would not support any legislation that proposes that. Some states are considering rate caps on what staffing agencies can charge hospitals and that could ultimately result in lowered salaries for nurses, an industry expert said.

Knowing that the GRF represents part of all state spending, and that the all funds budget is much larger, is an additional point that provides clarification. And while Budish couldn\u2019t provide documentation for his \"Ohio history\" reference, it is clear that Ohio has never passed a general revenue fund budget prior to 1968 that is anywhere in the stratosphere of what lawmakers are presently debating in the Statehouse.

The U.S. lead is predominantly due to its large stores of coal, yet coal\u2019s environmental effects pose a question mark for the future use of these resources.

And most able-bodied men were required to purchase weaponry for their service in the militia.

The bottom line is Free Market Florida contends\u00a0that man-made drainage canals will have to meet the same standards as pristine Florida river systems like the Wekiva River in Central Florida. As the regulations stand now, it appears that drainage canals designated as Class III waters in Central Florida would have to meet the same numeric nutrient standards as the Wekiva River. But there are several caveats that could impact the validity of that . For one, rules haven't been implemented for South Florida (home to the many drainage canals). Two, all drainage canals wouldn't have to meet the water quality standards of the Wekiva, just the ones in the geographic area. Three, the state is proposing a change to the rules that could exempt many of the state's drainage canals. And four, the EPA also says it could exempt individual drainage canals based on scientific study. Houck said his group made sure the drainage canal they showed is in the same region as the Wekiva, which in his mind explains away the first two caveats. The third and fourth caveats are possible changes that are not a sure thing. Where does this all leave us? Houck and his group are largely right based on all the  we reviewed.

Experts we spoke with said that was a pretty flimsy case. Obama\u2019s red line changed meaning from Clinton to Kerry. At first it was a rather ambiguous threat. Later, crossing it meant helping rebels obtain weapons and finally the announcement of military action. Further, the eventual agreement itself came quickly and almost unintentionally after Kerry made a rhetorical offer that Russia and Assad accepted.

The committee never has considered what should be in the salad bars of, say, restaurants or grocery stores. Brat\u2019s office said the congressman was referring to school salad bars. Brat points to the committee\u2019s May passage of a bill providing free breakfasts and lunches for students from low-income homes. The measure does not specify what vegetables should be served, and the panel spent no time haggling over amounts of lettuce, carrots and tomatoes. Setting nutritional standards would be left to the USDA. The bill largely would reauthorize free-meals legislation passed in 2010 that prioritized serving healthy food to students. In the aftermath, the USDA established copious regulations that include minimum weekly servings of green and red-orange vegetables and legumes. Many schools have salad bars, and it can be argued that Congress has allowed the USDA to regulate their contents. But it\u2019s hard to imagine any salad bar worth its salt not offering a mixture of vegetables. \u00a0So Brat\u2019s statement that the education committee is deciding salad bar contents - in schools or, perhaps, anywhere - is a stretch, and we rate it ."

But in the days that followed, neither he nor all the members of his administration spoke consistently on the subject. There were many suggestions that the attack was part of demonstrations over an American-made video that disparaged Islam. We rate the statement . Update: \u00a0 After we published this item, we heard from readers that the president called the attack \"an act of terror\" two more times -- on Sept. 13 in Colorado and Sept. 14 in Nevada . \"As for the ones we lost last night: I want to assure you, we will bring their killers to justice,\" Obama said at a campaign event in Nevada. \"And we want to send a message all around the world -- anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America.\" So as we noted in our original item, Romney is off the mark as it relates to the word \"terror.\" But Obama contributed to the administration's mixed message when he spoke at the Univision Town Hall event on Sept. 20. A questioner asked: \u00a0\"We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?\" Here is Obama\u2019s reply: \"Well, we\u2019re still doing an investigation, and there are going to be different circumstances in different countries. And so I don\u2019t want to speak to something until we have all the information. What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.\" So although Obama acknowledged the uncertainty, he emphasized the inflammatory video and the protest as contributing factors in the attack. By mentioning the video, Obama drew attention away from the possibility that the attack had been a planned assault. This lies at the heart of the dispute over what Obama and his administration were saying in the days after the attack. The president had the chance to be more complete and direct in Florida, but the administration was continuing to focus on the response to the video. Just four days earlier, Ambassador Rice downplayed the possibility that the attack was premeditated. The president\u2019s words did not correct that impression. So while Obama did use the word \"terror,\" there is also some  to Romney's point that it took many days for the administration to fully characterize the attack as the work of a terrorist group. So we're still rating this ."

The gap shrinks -- sometimes considerably -- when complicating factors such as pay per hour or the decisions of women to leave the work force to raise children are considered. The 77-cent statistic has been widely cited by PolitiFact and other fact-checkers as oversimplified and , yet it is still being used without qualification.

But the \"unprecedented\" idea is more nuanced. It\u2019s without question that the Supreme Court overturning a law passed by Congress -- by any margin -- is a common and routine occurrence, and by no means without precedent. Volokh gave us a close analogy with the case of Boerne vs. Flores , a religious freedom law that glided through Congress but was held unconstitutional by a majority of the court, including two of its liberal justices. However, Obama\u2019s elaboration a day later at least gives us more to think about. He argued that invalidation of the health care law would represent a court action unseen since the Great Depression on an issue that affects every American. Ornstein echoed that interpretation, saying that a ruling by the court which overturns a major social policy and challenges prior court rulings would be unprecedented. But we\u2019re taking Obama literally, and that historical perspective was not reflected in his original statement, which is what we're ruling on.

After the Fact After publishing this check, readers reached out telling us some Chevy Cruze sedans have also been imported from Mexico to sell in the United States. We asked General Motors about it, since their statement in response to Trump's tweet said all Cruze sedans sold in the United States are built in General Motors' assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. In a follow-up email, a General Motors spokesperson said, \"In the fourth quarter of 2016 we built some sedans in Mexico (and shipped to the U.S) to help support the launch of the Lordstown plant with the new Cruze (that was announced and reported on last summer) \u2013 about 8,000 total. So some of those are still in inventory in the U.S., but the only Chevrolet Cruze models being built in Mexico now for the U.S. market are the hatchbacks.\" The approximate 8,000 sedans were sold to dealers in 2016 \"and most were probably sold to consumers,\" General Motors spokesperson Patrick Morrissey said."

Correction, Feb. 24, 2015, 10:30 a.m.: An earlier version of this article said that a policy change that retroactively reduced sentences for certain prisoners convicted on drug charges played a role in the decline of the federal prison population in 2013. However, that policy change came in 2014 and is only going to affect populations in future years. The article has been updated to reflect this discrepancy. The change does not affect the ruling."

Those special-interest groups are certainly playing a much larger role this year, in part because they have become the major source of TV ad purchases. But the data also reveal that the candidates are being far more negative earlier in the campaign than they were four years ago, and that also drove up the percentage of negative ads in the beginning of 2012.

An analysis of budget data shows the total cut from just child care programs was closer to $1.1 billion, a bit less than Rendon\u2019s total. A very strict look at how much has been reinvested shows California put back $303 million of that $1.1 billion just to child care programs. The state Department of Finance, however, says the total is more than $450 million because some preschool funding actually pays for child care.

But each one of those trends began well before Obama was elected. Analysts say they have been driven by a natural and inevitable market correction much more than by any government policies. But since the ad draws a cause/effect relationship -- the cause being Obama\u2019s presidency, the effect being a sour housing market -- it\u2019s worth noting that more of the decline in home values happened on Bush\u2019s watch, and in the last year Florida housing has again begun to appreciate.

The lieutenant governor is right about the phone cost, though he selected the cheapest iPhone featured on Apple\u2019s website. In coming up with his health care cost estimate, Newsom\u2019s spokesman cited a federal report showing the nation\u2019s overall health care costs were expected to surpass $10,000 per capita for the first time in 2016. That figure does not necessarily mean everyone is spending $10,345 on health care. Costs vary greatly among individuals. About 5 percent of the population \u2014 those who are most frail or sick \u2014 accounts for nearly half the spending in a given year, according to the Associated Press. Still, two health care policy experts told us the $10,345 figure is the best available for assessing average health care costs. Another look at the iPhone vs. health care cost comparison by the Washington Post shows plans in the Obamacare market would cost an individual about $8,600 in premiums and deductibles annually, which when combined with out-of-pocket expenses might not be far from is the $10,345 figure Newsom cited.

And that court ruled there was no violation of federal law. * The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the California decision, so the decision stands. * A dozen states have enacted state laws to support tuition policies similar to the one approved in Rhode Island. In two states -- California and Texas -- the laws have been in effect for a decade. None has been successfully challenged.

We know that Justice can only track earmarks back to 2008 because prior to that they were largely inserted anonymously, but he includes campaign contributions dating back to 1998. That's not a  apples to apples comparison. And the numbers don't add up. We don't know where Justice got the $737,000 from -- originally we tallied more than $1 million in contributions (though a lot of that was double counted). Then, Justice's campaign provided us with a second document with another $1 million in contributions (and again, a lot of that was double counted). Granted, the number still totals nearly $800,000 when you add both documents together and only count unique contributions. But Justice's  is shaky because he is relying on two leaps of logic -- that any contributor who happens to be employed by a company is a \"recipient\" and that any lobbyist with a firm that did work for a recipient is tied to the earmark.

That\u2019s not exactly a comparison of life expectancy by race, but given that one ZIP code is heavily African-American and the other is heavily white, it\u2019s a reasonable proxy. As for the poverty , the rate remains high, but the 50 percent figure is based on old data. More recent estimates find that about a third of African-American children in the St. Louis area are living in poverty. On balance, we rate this \u00a0."

The studies we found, however, show that the risk of such physical attacks for teens isn't close to 1 in 4; it's more like 1 in 10. As with most social science research, the numbers can vary depending, for example, on how broadly dating violence is defined and the timeframe examined. A teen who is asked whether he or she has ever experienced dating violence may answer \"no,\" but then respond with a \"yes\" if asked if she has ever been pushed in anger by a boyfriend or girlfriend. What is clear is that to get to the types of numbers Lanzi is talking about, one must include all kinds of aggression, from physical attack to swearing at someone. In fact, when we talked to her, that was how she defined dating violence. No matter what the definition, all relationship abuse is reprehensible. But because Lanzi\u2019s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we rule it  . (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter .

We find this  on both points. Crist, while a vocal supporter of the stimulus and one of the only major Republicans endorsing the spending plan, did little to sway votes in Congress and get the stimulus bill passed into law. And the stimulus, while it had a few health care provisions, had little to do with the health care bill that eventually was passed by Congress. The seeds for the health care bill were sewn during Obama's presidential campaign in 2008, not at a town hall and hug in Fort Myers. All this to say, our first instinct was right. !"

There\u2019s a one-year lag in Virginia\u2019s school accreditation, however, and McAuliffe\u2019s campaign says he was referring to 2019 ratings that reflected Petersburg's academic performance from a year earlier, when McAuliffe left office. It\u2019s a credible argument that McAuliffe should be judged on the 2019 rates, but it\u2019s also highly advantageous to him because standards were eased that year and no Virginia public school was denied accreditation.\u00a0 Two of Petersburg\u2019s six schools were fully accredited in 2019, while 92% of schools across the state met that ideal. The other four were conditionally accredited, meaning they were performing below standards in at least one area and were required to take corrective actions. They were among the worst-performing 7% of Virginia schools. So there are problems with McAuliffe\u2019s , even when we give him the advantage of using the 2019 ratings. By saying all Petersburg schools were accredited - and deftly avoiding the distinction between fully and conditionally accredited - he creates a  impression of the city\u2019s progress during his term.

EDITOR\u2019S NOTE, Jan. 21, 2015 : After this article appeared, a reader pointed out another poll that had addressed public support for the Keystone XL pipeline that had been released the same day we published the story. A NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll taken in January 2015 asked respondents whether they favored or opposed building the pipeline, or whether they did \"not know enough about this topic to have an opinion.\" The inclusion of that last phrase increased the \"don\u2019t know\" response beyond that found in most other polls, to 37 percent. Of those who did have an opinion, 41 percent favored building Keystone XL and 20 percent opposed it. Because that's generally in line with what we found in the other polls, our original rating of  stands."

California\u2019s 3 percent job growth rate in 2015, which doubled Texas\u2019 pace, definitely fits into Brown's colorful . But California\u2019s rate has slowed to about 2 percent so far this year, closer to Texas\u2019 1.6 job growth rate. Other economic metrics show California faring better than Texas in several, though not all, categories: California\u2019s GDP expanded faster than Texas\u2019 GDP in the first two quarters of this year, though Texas had a faster GDP growth rate in 2015. Also, per capita income grew twice as fast in California as Texas in 2015, also backing Brown\u2019s statement. Texas, however, has consistently held a lower jobless rate than California in recent years. \u00a0 Brown, like the state\u2019s economy in recent years, is on the right track. Although California has expanded jobs and its economy faster than Texas in many cases, there are a few cases where that growth has been strong but not necessarily \"a hell of a lot faster.\" We rate Brown\u2019s statement .  \u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/158c502a-4b3e-463d-906f-529da13e2451"

This is a sweeping  that implies by its lack of specificity that officers are shielded from internal, criminal and civil liability by language in their union contract. Unions simply don\u2019t have that kind of power. Police unions do offer protections that can make it more difficult to discipline officers, or result in lesser punishments. But officers protected by union contracts are routinely fired, criminally charged and successfully sued in civil court. There\u2019s a point to be made about union contract influence, but Moore\u2019s attempt to make it was greatly exaggerated. We rate this  ."

The statistic comes from a report that assumes all reductions in Medicare Advantage spending results in fewer benefits for enrollees. While insurance providers feel the cuts, there are multiple ways for them to respond other than reducing benefits, such as trimming administrative costs. We heard from multiple experts and researchers who said Medicare Advantage benefits have remained stable. The ad also leaves out the fact that the federal health care law expanded Medicare\u2019s minimum required benefits and established incentives for Advantage plans to provide extra benefits.

Gingrich supports allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for legal status. He\u2019s said that process should look at each individual and whether they have \"family, church and community ties.\" They would also have to pay a fine. What he describes sounds like a more restrictive process than the 1986 law supported by Reagan that allowed for widespread amnesty. Still, most legal amnesties include some sort of process. Gingrich\u2019s plan is clearly an amnesty of sorts, though it is more limited in scope. The ad says Gingrich \"supports amnesty for illegal immigrants.\" That\u2019s a blunter  than the statement we rated previously from Romney, that Gingrich\u2019s plan is \"a new doorway to amnesty.\" Romney\u2019s comment implied that there was something new about Gingrich\u2019s plan rather than being the same amnesty policies of the past.

On the Koch side, the sources Trudeau cited did not say that all of the money connected to David and Charles Koch was their personal money. The Kochs have played a key role in creating a unique legal mechanism to raise and spend money that obscures the ultimate donors, and the nature of that mechanism gives them a high level of of control over how it is spent. To some extent, unions also feed into third-party money operations. And union political activity is spread much wider and among more organizations than the Kochs\u2019 giving. In short, a  apples-to-apples comparison is quite difficult. That said, one independent analysis of trackable federal data found organizations tied to the Kochs spent three and a half times what unions did in 2012. How does all of this shake out?
