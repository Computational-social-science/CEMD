Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies.

The stairway leads to a concrete ceiling, which now serves as the floor of an office above. Those changes were made by Marco Rubio in 2006. The stairs haven't been used since then. But that's not how Webster left it.\u00a0When he became speaker in 1996, Webster did what most every speaker has done in recent times -- he spent taxpayer money on House renovations. The amount has varied wildly over the years depending on the size of the renovation. Among the $100,000 or so Webster spent, he allocated just under $32,000 for a plain spiral staircase to internally link the Speaker's Office with the House Republican Offices below. While Grayson's ad is correct on the reported dollar amount and the type of staircase, we think it's slightly  for two reasons. First, the imagery displayed suggests an ornate staircase when the staircase is far from ornate and only a spiral staircase by necessity. Second, it fails to provide the context that most every speaker spends taxpayer dollars on renovations, and several spent more than Webster. We rate the  . Now cue the Led Zeppelin ...

The state paid even less, $22,242, Graham said). ( Update Sept. 3: We noticed that the Grayson ad has been removed from his You Tube web page. We're not sure why)."

While some insurance companies accept online payments and give Obamacare enrollees the option to pay immediately, many do not. In the Virginia-Maryland market for example, most companies mail bills to the new customers who come through the government marketplaces. That means customers don\u2019t even have the option of paying straight away. Also, while customers may not have paid, most states require a grace period of 30 or 31 days where insurers are required to pay claims.\u00a0 So maybe they don\u2019t intend to pay and will eventually lose their coverage.

However, the ad is a bit disengenuous because it really only addresses three disaster relief bills, and a couple of other\u00a0Arkansan delegates voted against final passage. The ad also\u00a0leaves out the times that Cotton voted for disaster relief funding, as long as there were spending cuts to other programs to make up for it. Overall, Cotton typically doesn\u2019t support spending that isn\u2019t balanced out with cuts in other areas. Additionally, if you think this ad -- which shows tornado-ravaged areas -- is talking all about Arkansas, that isn't the case. Most of these votes had to do with Hurricane Sandy. We rate this  .

Let's take this one step at a time. Alex Sink funneled ... This is a  verb choice. First, she was one of four statewide elected officials to agree to change the process for selling state bonds that ultimately resulted in paying $770,321 in commission fees to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. Second, she had no idea when she approved the new bond sale process -- called a negotiated sale -- that Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive $770,321. That came months later as part of the negotiations between the bond underwriters and the Division of Bond Finance. Three quarters of a million dollars ... The money in question is just about right. The total commission paid to Bank of America and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit was $770,321. In no-bid contracts ... This specific  has generated some controversy. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org, for instance, said that the contract at issue was not a no-bid contract . We disagree. Here are the facts. The state held an RFP for companies to be bond underwriters in general, not to specifically bid on bond sales. Thirty-nine companies responded, and ultimately 12 were chosen. There was no competitive bidding for the $300 million lottery revenue bond issue. The state negotiated a deal among those 12 companies. That's a no-bid contract to us, because the setup specifically prevents open competition that could produce lower interest rates. The state said it needed to pursue negotiated deals because of the volatility of the credit market, and maybe that's . But the question here is\u00a0whether there were bids for this specific bond issue. There were not. To Bank of America ... The fees actually were paid to Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America acquired. But what's critical to note, again, is that while Bank of America interests represented two of the 12 members of the state bond underwriting team, Sink had no idea when she approved the slate of underwriters what specific role each bank would play in any specific bond sale. And even when she approved the $300 million lottery bond issue, it wasn't yet clear whether the sale of those bonds would be by a competitive or negotiated process. The resolution she and three others approved included either option. We should note that the ad claims that \"your tax dollars\" paid for the Bank of America commissions. That's not . The bond issue was using lottery revenues, not general tax revenues. That means you buying lottery tickets paid for the bond sale and the bank commissions. The basis of the  in the Scott ad is a paragraph in a St. Petersburg Times story about Sink, saying she \"voted with the governor and other Cabinet members to allow negotiated, or no-bid, bond deals for a financial underwriting team that includes her former employer, Bank of America. One transaction resulted in $770,000 in fees for a subsidiary of the bank and its newly acquired Merrill Lynch unit.\" That statement is accurate, as it properly notes that the negotiated bond sale process resulted in $770,000 in fees for Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, without trying to tie the money directly to Sink. Scott isn't nearly as careful in his TV ad. Particularly, his use of the word \"funneled\" overshadows some of the facts Scott gets right in his . Sink didn't funnel $770,000 to Bank of America. First, she was one of four votes on the Cabinet to approve the particular type of bond issue in question -- along with Republicans Charlie Bronson and Bill McCollum and then-Republican Charlie Crist.\u00a0 Second, she had no way of knowing how much commission Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would receive for the bond sale when she approved the deal. Those details came months later during negotiations between state bond administrators and the banks. We rate Scott's  ."

In fact, the money Langevin\u2019s campaign owes is not to other people, but to one individual -- Langevin himself. Eighteen years ago, the candidate loaned $280,000 to his campaign. In 2006, he tried to get that money back, running afoul of state election laws. There's a big difference between owing money to others and trying to recoup funds you loaned to your own campaign, especially when Langevin is under no obligation to ever pay himself back in the first place. So Matson is correct in saying that Langevin is still trying to pay off debt racked up while running for secretary of state, but his statement leaves out important facts that might give voters a very different impression.

The bill, with Warner\u2019s support, passed by a 60-39 vote.

Still, Green overstepped in ignoring the contract revisions Emanuel\u2019s administration negotiated to gain flexibility in work assignments and reduce base salary for newly hired workers. The designated tree trimmers on the city payroll were all hired before Emanuel took office and get paid under contract terms agreed to years before he became mayor. That said, overtime costs for tree trimmers have soared under Emanuel, and that is why the total compensation for some city tree trimmers has hit the six-figures. Green gets most, but not all of his  about tree-trimmer pay right, which is why we rate it ."

I said that was unacceptable. I challenged that notion. I said the mayor needs to be involved with our schools. We need to partner together. As I left, after a number of reforms, we grew our graduation rate from 44 percent to 72.\" A 2006 study by the nonpartisan Education Week placed the district\u2019s graduation rate at 44 percent, while a Harvard study the year before placed the rate at 45.3 percent. They both used enrollment data from the early 2000s. School district officials in 2006 disputed the findings, saying improvements had been made and the rate was closer to 64 percent. District data shows that rate had climbed to 70.2 percent immediately after Villaraigosa\u2019s term ended. It rose to 72.2 percent and then 77 percent in the following two years. Several observers of Los Angeles politics and education said Villaraigosa doesn\u2019t get all the credit but did play an outsized role. He helped elect a reform-minded school board, install a superintendent and created a nonprofit that took control of and helped improve the district\u2019s worst performing schools. The dispute over the district\u2019s view of its graduation rate is missing from Villaraigosa\u2019s statement. As is the fact that the studies used data from the early 2000s, a few years before Villaraigosa took office. But there\u2019s certainly  to back up the former mayor\u2019s  about graduation rate improvements and his influence. In the end, we rate Villaraigosa\u2019s  .  \u00a0\u2013 The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Jones said an inspection would cost $100 to $150, citing a Department of Health estimate. Spread over five years, that's an investment of as little as $30 a year -- much less than homeowners with a central sewer system pay. But that's not telling the entire story. Experts we talked to said the price of an inspection could cost up to $500 and depends on a number of variables. On top of that, the inspection could result in finding problems that could require repairs at additional cost. That's obviously part of the intent of the bill, but it comes at a cost nevertheless.

While only two states -- Georgia and Indiana -- required a photo ID to vote before 2008, Michigan, South Dakota, Louisiana, Florida and Hawaii, requested a photo ID, according to NCSL data. That means at least seven states -- not two, as Vincent claimed -- were demanding or asking for a photo ID for the 2008 election that put Obama in office. No matter which standard you use, the number of states adopting more-restrictive voter identification requirements has increased since 2008.

Roosevelt said, \"The program for social security now pending before the Congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government. \u2026 It proposes, by means of old age pensions, to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work and to give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age.\" When we showed this statement to a couple of the historians we had originally interviewed, they acknowledged that it was an unusually clear statement on Roosevelt\u2019s part, but they added that it is an exception within the documentary record. \"Promoting retirement was a minor goal at best of the old-age parts of the legislation,\" said University of California-Irvine sociologist Edwin Amenta.

But the advertisements say nothing about the fact that Prop 30 was a temporary measure, and that its revenue was not promised forever. Nor do they mention that school budgets will continue to go up for several years until the Prop 30 revenue runs out after 2018. Supporters of 55 point to an estimated $4 billion school funding deficit by the 2019-2020 fiscal year, if the measure fails. They also cite a separate $4 billion operating shortfall for all its services by the same year. Another respected financial outlook, however, projects a $2 billion operating surplus for California that same year. That estimate paints a very different picture. If the ads had said Prop 55\u2019s failure could lead to eventual school funding hardships, years from now, they would have been more accurate. But they leave the impression that the measure\u2019s failure will lead to deep school cuts much sooner. And that\u2019s not the case.

Kaine, six days after taking office in 2006, did propose a plan to raise about $1 billion a year for transportation. Trump calls it a \"nearly $4 billion tax increase,\" citing a figure used in a newspaper article at the time. But the article said that sum would be realized over four years. Trump, in using that high $4 billion figure, omits the clarifying time span. The tax package centered on raising levies on auto insurance and vehicle purchases in addition to increasing car registration fees. It would have affected people with taxable incomes of $17,000 or lower - if they had a car. So Trump\u2019s statement largely is accurate but needs some clarification.

A group of St. Pete Beach residents, unhappy with the direction of their city government, successfully wrestled certain land use decisions out of the hands of elected leaders. The movement produced a backlash from both the government and pro-development forces, who then mounted their own political campaign to wrestle power back. The power struggle has continued for close to four years. That's a different storyline than what is envisioned under Amendment 4, where voters would act as a check on the decisions of local government. The amendment itself isn't designed to go around government the way the situation in St. Pete Beach played out. And it has nothing to do with citizens proposing amendments to the local comprehensive plan, like what has happened in St. Pete Beach. Now, are the same lawsuits and political maneuvering possible? Absolutely. And maybe that's enough to make the analogy valid. But voters should be wary in blindly believing that St. Pete Beach's experiences would be duplicated statewide should Amendment 4 pass.

Close to half of fourth-grade students in Florida failed to meet a \"Basic\" level of reading as defined by the federal government in 1998.

There is a connection between the federal money and the clinics. A program specialist whose salary was paid for through the grant promoted the clinics, and the grant-funded animal control officers were on hand at the clinics. But it\u2019s not accurate to say that the money was used to spay or neuter the animals. And the money did not come from an \"Obamacare slush fund\" -- it wasn't part of the health care law. Calling it a \"slush fund\" could lead readers to view it as a secretive stash of money, when in reality Congress approved the stimulus act that included money for community-based prevention.

Legal experts say businesses are allowed to ask for proof of vaccination from customers. In some states, certain businesses are required to ask about vaccination status under current reopening guidelines.\u00a0 Additionally, businesses can generally deny entry to unvaccinated customers, provided they offer reasonable accommodations for people who might be unable to receive a vaccine because of a disability, a medical condition or their religious beliefs. Experts say a reasonable accommodation does not necessarily mean the individual would be able to walk into the business or access their services in person. Experts also say that the law cited as punishment applies to public officials, not private businesses.

It may not be the best example, though, because some experts suggest it may not be as vulnerable as other parts of the law. Experts outlined a range of other Medicare provisions that either provided new benefits or shored up the program\u2019s financial fitness. If the whole law were to be nullified, as the administration has advocated, these changes could also be erased \u2014 a step that would affect benefits and potentially cause premiums to rise.

We rate Clinton\u2019s statement . https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/542ece9a-ae39-433c-8215-4a41906b75c9 The now former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made a comment when speaking before Congress May 8, 2017, that some readers interpreted as going against our findings in this article. Here\u2019s why we disagree with that interpretation. We wrote this article Oct. 19, 2016, responding to an Oct. 7, 2016 , joint statement from Clapper\u2019s former office, which oversees the entire intelligence community, and Homeland Security. Clapper\u2019s May 2017 congressional testimony, on the other hand, was about the much more comprehensive January 2017 report produced by the CIA, FBI and NSA. The process of putting that report together didn\u2019t start until months after we published this article, in December 2016, at which point the intelligence community decided to restrict the investigation to those three agencies. Here\u2019s what Clapper said, according to Congressional Quarterly . (\"ICA\" refers to the January 2017 \"intelligence community assessment.\") \"Additionally, I'll briefly address four related topics that have emerged since the ICA was produced. Because of both classification and some executive privilege strictures requested by the White House, there are limits to what I can discuss. And of course my direct official knowledge of any of this stopped on 20 January when my term of office was happily over. \"As you know, the (ICA) was a coordinated product from three agencies; CIA, NSA, and the FBI not all 17 components of the intelligence community. Those three under the aegis of my former office. Following an extensive intelligence reporting about many Russian efforts to collect on and influence the outcome of the presidential election, President Obama asked us to do this in early December and have it completed before the end of his term.\" The January report presented its findings by saying \"we assess,\" with \"we\" meaning \"an assessment by all three agencies.\" The October statement, on the other hand, said \"The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident\" in its assessment. As we noted in the article, the 17 separate agencies did not independently come to this conclusion, but as the head of the intelligence community, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence speaks on behalf of the group. We stand by our rating."

Still, Maher\u2019s unequivocal statement glosses over some diversity within the GOP\u2019s ranks. On religion, Maher's  comes down to how you view Mormonism. On race, the question is even more murky. There are two members of federally recognized American Indian tribes, which is classified as a race by the U.S. Census Bureau, and there are as many 10 Republicans in the House and Senate with Hispanic roots. Some may consider their race white,\u00a0Hispanic or something else. Also, Cantor isn\u2019t leaving office until the end of his term in January. It\u2019s possible the November elections will bring non-Christian or non-white Republican members who will take office when Cantor leaves.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said there was no  the drugs themselves were substandard. The World Health Organization, South Africa\u2019s Medicines Control Council and the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency tested the Ranbaxy drugs and found them to be safe. Such testing dates back to at least 2005. We rate this statement . Update and correction (Sept. 29, 2016): After this item posted, we heard from Mark Tapscott, executive editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation, a 501(c)3 organization that says it provides investigative reporting for the public benefit. The group does not publicly list its donors. Tapscott listed what he called nine factual errors in our story. We reviewed his claims and found most of them without merit, as they failed to distinguish between Ranbaxy\u2019s HIV/AIDS drugs and its other products. Tapscott, however, correctly noted that in 2004 WHO decertified three of Ranbaxy\u2019s HIV/AIDS drugs. Ranbaxy\u2019s HIV/AIDS drugs were recertified the following year. The story now reflects that information, as well as the correct year in which the Justice Department filed charges against Ranbaxy.

Cornyn voted for the 2008 bailout and has occasionally voted to raise the debt ceiling. Also, Cornyn\u2019s 2013 vote for the taxpayer-relief act raised taxes for most households though, signficantly, it also preserved lower income-tax rates than ones that would have hit if the measure didn\u2019t make it into law. Finally, the idea that Cornyn voted to fund Obamacare by agreeing to general appropriations is a political turnip; how those votes are interpreted probably depends on one\u2019s political prism. Beyond that, the government evidently can tap the funding it needs to implement the law regardless of congressional spending decisions. Cornyn voted against the Obamacare law when it came to be and continues to oppose it. We rate this partially accurate , which takes some votes out of context, as . CORRECTION, 1:13 p.m., Dec. 12, 2013 : This story has been amended to reflect Cornyn\u2019s vote against raising the debt ceiling in October 2013.

But the author of that study was emphatic in saying that he could not prove that the increase was due to right-to-work laws. And the author of the Wall Street commentary Kettle cites also says pro-business policies matter for growth, not right-to-work laws specifically. The same can be said of the multiple business climate indexes we found. They did generally rank right-to-work states higher than union states, but they considered many other factors, including tax policy, that could account for the better rankings.

He was forced to use the state\u2019s open records law to get information and waited months for it.

Whether it was part of a long-running political wrangle between the mayor and the City Council, which hires the internal auditor, is irrelevant.

His office cites the bleakest of nine scenarios in Deloitte studies, under which 42 percent of workers would lose their company insurance. The Cantor camp doesn\u2019t mention that most of the other scenarios estimate a loss under 10 percent. We found five other studies that conclude the law will cause less than a 3 percent net loss of workers with company insurance. That group includes people expected to voluntarily give up their work policies because they prefer private plans that will become available under the health care act. Even before the coverage mandate has taken effect, the number of companies that switch their plans each year has been substantial. The health care law is expected to increase that rate modestly, not exponentially as Cantor says. We rate Cantor\u2019s statement ."

The second part of his , that increased property crime is \"the kind of thing that happens when cities defund and deemphasize police,\" appears to be based on assumption. Researchers have demonstrated how numerous intervening factors confound the relationship between police force size and crime. Rather, strategic crime deterrent strategies are seen as having a more direct impact on crime rates. We rate this  ."

There\u2019s no way to know how the differences between the two affect the net worth numbers, but Moore used the data that are available and there\u2019s no indication he \"cherry-picked\" figures for a desired result, Mitchell said. With that caveat, our assessment indicates that as of 2009, the net worth of the nation\u2019s 400 wealthiest individuals exceeds the net worth of half of all American households.

It also pointed to federal data showing manufacturing workers in Texas made $100 more per week on average than their Illinois counterparts. But such numbers belie the fact that Illinois couldn\u2019t be Texas if it tried. The more populous state has grown its manufacturing \u2014 and therefore, its union \u2014 jobs thanks to a booming economy that\u2019s received a major boost from its oil and gas industry, something Illinois thanks to its geography and geology simply doesn\u2019t have.
