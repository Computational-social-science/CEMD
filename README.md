# CEMD

Existing misinformation detection benchmark datasets (e.g., COVMIS and LIAR2) are limited by their reliance on fact-checking labels that are prone to factual inaccuracies due to cognitive constraints of fact-checkers and outdated labels. Prior real-time misinformation detection tasks have been hindered by the dual problems of label redundancy and cold start. To this end, we propose a novel Cyclic Evidence-based Misinformation Detection (CEMD) framework, which incorporates two core mechanisms: (i) a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that accesses the latest external knowledge to augment insufficient prior knowledge, and (ii) a cyclic evidence-bootstrapping mechanism that mitigates label redundancy and cold start.
